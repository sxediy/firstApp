# firstApp
  This is my first application. 

  What is that and how is it work ?
So I will try to explain now in a nutshell.

  This is the form of user data, displayed list of users with their data that will render to document after clicking the "Отправить" button  and ability to change the data according to some rules and delete user or mark users with one click. It's still possible to sort the list in different ways. Now in order.
  First things first.

Step1: Regarding a some RegEx pattern we can to input a correct name of user. What is correct and what is not is have a subjective.

Step2: Age of user must be between 0-117 years because according to Wikipedia the oldest person who now lives is 三宅金治郎 . His age is 116 years and several months. Аlmost 2 years later he won't be able to register here but but but...but the world of Web is so rapidly developing that I will rewrite this application, which will take into account the age of this respected person on the basis of artificial intelligence.)))

Step3: Onece these 2 required fields are filled you can safely to click the "Отправить" button.

Step4: JavaScript, CSS and HTML to make a wonders for you! See descriptions to code inside event.js file to understand how it's work at the logic level of the programming language.

Step5: There was a row of data user. Now we can edit the data or delete the user data object from the data array and remove the data line from the interface. All you need to do is click the appropriate buttons. 

Step6: If we add another user than will appear two additional buttons that a responsible for sorting by alphabet and age both in direct and reverse order. All you need to change a direction of sorting is click the appropriate button and will see direction of the vertex of the triangle. Next clicks a switch direction again and again.

Step7: We can also mark the user's box for delete mark items with one click . Button "Удалить отмеченные" for this purpose. Once you mark at least one item  - buttons of sort is disappear and button 'Удалить' becomes inaccessible.

Step7: You can reppeat all these steps again and again.

When deleting data from an array, it does not create holes.
Sorting in the DOM is performed using the Flexbox.
Сonstruction of the main semantic elements of the document with Grid Layout.
File form.css sets styles to input form. Userdata.css sets styles  to lines of data users and button to them.
